Since Cristina's birth, he feels he has lost the privileged position of \"prince\" of the house for his eight months old sister. So, with his brother Juan, who is eight years old and is quite disobedient, spend their time committing prank after prank, causing the resulting anger of his mother, the nanny and the old housemaid. The rest of the family members are two much older brothers, his resigned mother and a retrograde father of authoritarian ideas.

L.R. runs across the street to a convenience store to buy some more, a quick trip of no more than a few minutes. When he returns, Vespa is gone and every trace of her existence has been wiped out. L.R.'s life becomes a tortured existence as one strange event after another occurs to confirm in his mind that a conspiracy is working against his finding Vespa.  \\\n",
